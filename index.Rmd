## Filter Columns and Rows

In order to filter columns and rows in dplyr, you must use the functions select and filter.  Let's look at an example using the Lahman baseball database.

We first must load the Lahman and dplyr packages.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)
```

Now, lets use dplyr in order to look at the homeruns and players of the 1927 New York Yankees:
```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
HR<-Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(teamID == "NYA" & yearID==1927)

head(HR)

```
